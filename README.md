# Python_Group_10_Project
## Project Description and Purpose:

The goal of this project was to create an application using the Model View Controller 
design scheme to organize the flow of information throughout the program. This application allows users to 
upload sound files to an application 
that then cleans up the data, analyzes the data, and then displays the data as visual output through different graphs. 

## Usage Instructions: 

To run this application, the Sound_main.py file needs to be run from an IDE with
 the necessary packages pip installed as specified in the requirements.txt file. 
When the application loads, the “Pick File” is pressed. This allows the user to 
choose a file from file explorer. After the filename loads in the top of the window, the “Analyze File” is 
pressed and the file length, resonance frequency, and RT60 Difference labels are updated, and the buttons for displaying plots appear. 
The user can then press any of the plot selection buttons in order to display different graphs in the center of the window. 
The RT Plots drop down menu can be used to choose between Low, Medium, and High RT60 Plots.

***Disclaimer:***
***This application is intended for larger monitors, the RT60 Difference label may be cut of if it is run on a laptop. This problem can be avoided by hiding the taskbar.***
